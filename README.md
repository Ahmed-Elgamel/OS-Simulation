# OS-Simulation
This project aims to simulate the fundamental workings of an operating system through the development of a basic interpreter. 
The system involves reading program text files and executing them as processes, managing memory allocation, implementing mutexes for resource protection, and creating a scheduler for process management. 
The project encompasses essential system calls, such as reading and writing files, displaying data on the screen, and managing memory. 
Additionally, it introduces the concept of Process Control Blocks (PCB) to store critical process information. 
The system comprises three main programs, each with specific syntax for execution. 
The project's key components include a code parser/interpreter, system call handling, mutex implementation, scheduler development, and memory management.
